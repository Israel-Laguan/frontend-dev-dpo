    "instruction": "I am trying to register a service worker in my PWA, but it seems like it's not registering properly. Here's my code snippet, but I can't tell if there's an issue:\n\n```javascript\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\nWhy might this not be working, and what should I check or correct?",
    "rejected": "The registration might be failing due to an issue with the service worker file or scope. Verify that `sw.js` is in the correct directory and accessible. Also, make sure you have HTTPS enabled, as service workers require it. Check for errors in the console.",
    "chosen": "When registering a service worker, certain issues can prevent successful registration. Here's a detailed troubleshooting approach based on your code:\n\n1. **Check the File Path**: Ensure the `sw.js` file is in the correct directory (in this case, the root directory `/`). If `sw.js` isn't at the root, adjust the file path accordingly.\n\n2. **HTTPS Requirement**: Service workers require a secure context, so make sure your PWA is served over HTTPS (except for localhost during development).\n\n3. **Console Errors**: Open the browser's Developer Console to check for specific error messages. Any issues with scope, HTTPS, or file accessibility will often show up there.\n\nHere's your code with enhanced logging to capture any issues more specifically:\n\n```javascript\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n      console.error('Please ensure sw.js is in the root directory and the site is served over HTTPS.');\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **File Location**: If `sw.js` is in a different directory, change the path in the `register` method accordingly.\n- **Permissions**: If this is a localhost setup, service workers will work over `http://localhost`. For production, ensure HTTPS is in use.\n\nThis should help isolate the issue and clarify why the service worker is not registering."

    "instruction": "I'm trying to use a custom font on my webpage, but the font isn't loading as expected. I followed the steps to link the WOFF2 format and added a CSS rule, but it's still not displaying. What could be going wrong here? Here's my code snippet:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n\n<!-- CSS in styles.css -->\n@font-face {\n    font-family: 'MyFont';\n    src: url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2');\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-style: normal;\n}\n\nbody {\n    font-family: 'MyFont', sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\nCould you help me identify the issue?",
    "rejected": "You might have missed a file or font type. Try linking the WOFF format instead. Here's a fix:\n\n```html\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'MyFont';\n  src: url('myfont.woff') format('woff');\n}\n```\nIf that doesn't work, try reloading the page.",
    "chosen": "The code provided is mostly correct, but there are a few common issues that might prevent the font from loading. Here are potential solutions:\n\n1. **File Path Issue**: Ensure that `myfont.woff2` is in the correct directory relative to `styles.css`. If the font file is located in a `fonts` folder, adjust the `src` path like so:\n\n   ```css\n   src: url('./fonts/myfont.woff2') format('woff2');\n   ```\n\n2. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If loading the font from a different domain (e.g., a CDN), add `crossorigin=\"anonymous\"` to the `<link>` tag in the HTML:\n\n   ```html\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n   ```\n\n3. **Preloading the Font**: Preloading can improve performance and ensure the font is ready to display when the page loads. Add this line to your HTML:\n\n   ```html\n   <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"./fonts/myfont.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n   ```\n\nHere's the corrected HTML and CSS:\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- HTML -->\n   <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"./fonts/myfont.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n   ```\n\n   ```css\n   /* CSS in styles.css */\n   @font-face {\n       font-family: 'MyFont';\n       src: url('./fonts/myfont.woff2') format('woff2');\n       font-weight: normal;\n       font-style: normal;\n   }\n\n   body {\n       font-family: 'MyFont', sans-serif;\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring the file path is correct, handling CORS if necessary, and preloading the font, the custom font should now display correctly on the webpage."

    "instruction": "I'm having trouble with my React component's state not updating properly. Here's my code:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  \n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n    setCount(count + 1);\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={increment}>Add 3</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWhen I click the button, the count only increases by 1 instead of 3. Why isn't it working?",
    "rejected": "The issue is with your setState calls. They're not working because React batches updates. You should use the functional update form. Here's the fix:\n```jsx\nsetCount(prev => prev + 1);\n```",
    "chosen": "I understand you're encountering an issue with state updates in your React component. This is actually a common gotcha in React related to state updates and batching. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.\n\nThe reason your count only increases by 1 instead of 3 is because React batches state updates for performance. In your current code, all three `setCount(count + 1)` calls are using the same value of `count` from the closure, so they're effectively setting the same value three times.\n\nHere's the corrected version with detailed explanations:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  \n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(prev => prev + 1);\n    setCount(prev => prev + 1);\n    setCount(prev => prev + 1);\n  }\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={increment}>Add 3</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations:\n\n1. We're now using the functional update form of `setCount`, which receives the previous state as an argument\n2. Each update is guaranteed to work with the latest state value\n3. The updates will be processed in sequence, ensuring all three increments take effect\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to add 3 directly, you could simplify it to:\n\n```jsx\nconst increment = () => {\n  setCount(prev => prev + 3);\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern is important to remember whenever you need to update state based on its previous value in React. The functional update form ensures you're always working with the most current state value."
