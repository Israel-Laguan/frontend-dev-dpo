# DPO JavaScript Dataset

This repository contains a modified and expanded version of a closed-source JavaScript dataset. The dataset has been adapted to fit the DPO (Dynamic Programming Object) format, making it compatible with the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) project. The dataset includes a variety of JavaScript code snippets with optimizations and best practices, generated using closed-source tools and expanded by me.

## License

This dataset is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of JavaScript code snippets that have been restructured and enhanced for use in training and fine-tuning models. Each entry in the dataset follows a specific format designed to facilitate dynamic programming tasks and code optimizations.

## Conversion Process

The adaptation to the DPO format was carried out using a combination of closed-source tools and manual expansion. Each row from the original dataset was transformed into a structure that fits the requirements of LLaMA-Factory, ensuring a seamless integration into various applications. The dataset includes examples of common JavaScript issues and their optimized solutions.

## Usage

To utilize this dataset in your projects, you can easily load it using the Hugging Face `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("israellaguan/frontend_dpo")
```

## Contribution

Contributions to improve the dataset or the adaptation process are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements
